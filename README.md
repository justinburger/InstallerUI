InstallerUI
===========

Installer UI is a front-end to the Installer Github deployment system.




TO DO
===========
* Better Error handling: Need to verify org, env, and tags prior to sending them to the backend tool.
* Better promotion error handling: If their is a deployment failure, make sure the frontend UI knows about it.
* Better polling: Polling of progress bars needs improvement to use memory and ajax calls more efficiently.
* Better setup process: Right now, the user has to change the point-to location within the install code. This should be changed to an external config.
* Permission support: Need to have some sort of authenication process. Hopefully using Github.
